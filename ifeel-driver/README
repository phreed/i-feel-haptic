Introduction :

Thankyou for downloading the iFeel USB driver. 

At the current time, the driver hasn't been through a lot of testing so
USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

It was also written in a very short amount of time so don't expect a
lot.  I plan to add to it eventually, but at the moment I have more
assignments than time to do them in.  So, if you want to help with this
project, by all means let me know, and if you have any comments, let me
know.

Oh yeah, if you really, really want support for your vibrating mouse,
let me know and things might move a little quicker.

Have fun buzzing.

**************************************************

Installing :
To use the iFeel driver, you must have a Logitech iFeel mouse (not sure
about the mouseman) with vibrating support and a current 2.4.* kernel

All the following steps need to be run as root.

1) Edit the Makefile to point to your current kernel source directory

2) Run 'make node' to make a devfs node for the mouse.

3) Run 'make all' to create a kernel module and a userspace program to
   send buzz requests to the mouse

4) Make sure that usbmouse and hid aren't in your kernel ie
	rmmod hid
	rmmod usbmouse
   and input is
	insmod input

5) Run 'make ins' to insert the module into your kernel.  If all goes
   well, you should see a message saying iFeel is registered.

6) In order for normal users to use the ifeel0 device, you will need to
   change the permissions on the ifeel0 file with to allow normal users
   to use it.
   For now, just use 
     chown <user> ifeel0
   It isn't the best way to do it, but for now, it's only for testing.

Useage:
iFeel uses 'input' to process mouse movement and click events so point
anything that uses the mouse to /dev/input/mice. 

To access the vibrate functionality, use the ifeel_send command.  This
requires the ifeel node to be created with 'make node'

For the more adventurous types, look at the code for ifeel_send to see
how to send requests directly.
