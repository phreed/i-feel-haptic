This directory contains dumps of the USB stream as the iFeel mouse
was vibrating. At the time of this dump, the mouse sensor was taped over
and the mouse was flipped upside down to prevent any movement data
from being captured. I used another mouse to control the cursor.

The ifeel.data file is just the data that seems to be important. They are
all control data transfers. Not sure what to make of it yet...
